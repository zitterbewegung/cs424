      will be an individual project to give people practice with writing
      an application in processing and get everyone ready to contribute
      to the group projects to come. In this project everyone will learn
      how to get data into processing, how to write an interactive
      processing application, and how to create an effective user
      interface for viewing and analyzing this data. This will give
      everyone a common basis for communication In the later group
      projects where people will specialize in different tasks.<br>
      <br>
      The project will take a look at termperature data collected from
      various rooms in evl over the last six years. You job is to create
      an interactive visualization and analysis tool to help the user
      better understand what affects the temperature in evl. This tool
      will allow the user to decide things such as: how warm to dress
      for a given day and room, where to place new equipment so rooms
      and the equipment don't get too hot, how to change the settings
      for the university heating and cooling, etc.<br>

        For the last six years we have used a one-wire system to monitor
        temperatures in the lab. Every minute new temperature data is
        collected and displayed. Each hour the current temperatures are
        saved to a text file. At this point the data comes to 15 MB.<br
          style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
        <br style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">
        <span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);"> The data is available
          at www.evl.uic.edu/aej/424/11p1data/history.txt.zip</span><br>
        <br>
        In this case the data is already pre-processed to be an
        appropriate size and in an easily readable form. That won't hold
        true for the later assignments. <br>
        <br>
        Each line of the file looks like: May/04/2008 10:00 PM
        FF00080057FB1810&nbsp; 67<br>
        <br>
        The first element is the date, the second is the hour and
        minute, the third is AM or PM, the fourth is the sensor ID, and
        the fifth is the temperature in degrees Fahrenheit.<br>
        <br>
        The temperature sensorIDs can be correlated to rooms<br>

        Here is a small map showing where the various rooms are
        geographically. While this project will primarily rely on graphs
        to show the data, you will very likely need to show some kind of
        simplified map as an informational graphic to tell the user
        which room is which. <br>
        <img style=" width: 805px; height: 452px;"
          src="11p1data/room_layout_annotated.jpg" alt="room layout for
          temperature sensors"><br>
        <br>
        There is a non-annotated version of the map at <span
          style="color: rgb(255, 255, 255);">www.evl.uic.edu/aej/424/11p1data/evl_2nd_floor.jpg</span>
        that you might help.<br>
        <br>
        in general the data is collected on each hour (eg 10:00) but if
        the program was offline at that time it might be at a different
        minute. There may also be holes in the data due to power
        failures or program crashes.<br>
        <br>
        While the data files contain a few more days, for this project
        we will focus on the days from aug 1 2005 through jul 31 2011<br>
        <br>
        You should start by looking at data itself and do some simple
        plots and statistics in your favourite spreadsheet / plotting
        program.&nbsp; This will give you an idea of the range of the
        data and what data is missing. If you haven't used shell scripts
        before to parse data then you should become acquainted with
        them. grrep, awk, sed and their friends will save you a lot of
        time. <br>
        <br>
        What kinds of patterns are visible? Your job is to help the user
        look beyond the cyclical patterns for longer term trends and
        aberrations that are hiding there, and see what changes in the
        real world could have caused them. Some of these changes are
        related to how hot a summer was or how cold a winter was, others
        are related to human behavior - when are people coming in to the
        lab and turning on machines? when does the university turn on
        the heating or the air conditioning?<br>
        <br>
        The goal here is to create an interactive visualization tool to
        aid in your analysis and to back up any conclusions you draw. <br>
        <br>
        You will very likely need to relate this data to other data
        sources such as the schedule of classes, outdoor Chicago
        temperatures, calendars.<span style="color: rgb(255, 255, 0);"></span><br>
      </div>
      <br>
      <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;"><br>
      Your visualization and analysis tool should be written in
      processing. As this is primarily a graph-based visualization the
      Milk / Tea / Coffee example should give you a nice head start on
      this. As graphs are a very common visualization this will give you
      a chance to write a set of graphing code that you can reuse and
      improve in future assignments.<br>
      <br>
      You should start by getting processing installed and doing some
      initial tests to load in the data and start displaying it. You
      should then start to draw some sketches of what the interface
      might look like and how you want to arrange and display the data.
      You can use other software to generate statistics about the data
      if you find that useful but be sure to document that process. Be
      careful of missing data when you generate statistics. <br>
      <br>
      In past terms the students have shown a desire to show all of the
      data to the user right away. You should be careful not to
      overwhelm the user. As Schneiderman said "overview first, zoom and
      filter, details on demand." Appropriate levels of aggregating data
      will be very important here.<br>
      <br>
      It is also important to note that 'getting it to work' is just a
      prerequisite to using the application to find answers to your
      questions. It is that usage that will give you ideas on how to
      improve your app to make it easier and more intuitive to find
      those things.<br>

    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;">You should

      <li>1 page containing an embedded processing window (max size 1024

      put some effort into it.</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      You should also create a 2-3 minute youtube video showing the use
      of your application including narration with decent audio quality.
      That video should be in a very obvious place on your main project
      web page. The easiest way to do this is to use a screen-capture
      tool while interacting with the application, though you will most
      likely find its useful to do some editing afterwards to tighten
      the video up. Its also a good idea to have a video like this
      available as a backup during your presentation just in case of
      gremlins.</span><br>
    <span style="font-family: Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif;"><br>
      I will be linking your web page to the course notes so please send
      me a nice 1024 x 768 jpg image of your visualization for the web.
